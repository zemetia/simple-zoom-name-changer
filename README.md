# simple-zoom-name-changer
Designed and Created by me.
For Reason I am almost forgot to change my Zoom name at all of the time in zoom
and too lazy to change the name from the web.

Yeah this have some cools features That I think for lazylazyman like me (hahaha)
1. for the link you can copy the zoom link like "https://zoom.us/xxxxxxx?pwd=xxxxxxxx" (if It has Password)
2. and just type the Zoom's ID on same textbox if it has no Password.

And at the name you just can type like
```
[name]_[kota]
=> Yoel Mountanus Sitorus_Pematangsiantar
```
and then will shown like that.. Fuckin' cool right?:V
I'm just too lazy dude hahaha.

Oh yaa you can edit it from the script.js file
edit the "data" dictionary

```javascript
let data = {name:"Yoel Mountanus Sitorus",
            nrp:"5025211078",
            kota:"Siantar",
            n3:"078",
            fname:"Yoel",
            dept:"Teknik Informatika",
            fak:"FTEIC",
            div:"Divisi Pendidikan",
            anjai:"halo"}; 
```
u will see this stuff and u can add some more.
example u add
```
bapak: "Anjai lu"
```

Then when u open the HTML file just type
```
[bapak]123
//Then it will shown
=> Anjai lu123
```
