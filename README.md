# simple-zoom-name-changer
Designed and Created by me.<br>
For Reason I am almost forgot to change my Zoom name at all of the time in zoom<br>
and too lazy to change the name from the web.<br>
You can check this simple project on my Web: http://project.zymerweb.rf.gd/zoom

Yeah this have some cools features That I think for lazylazyman like me (hahaha)
1. for the link you can copy the zoom link like "https://zoom.us/xxxxxxx?pwd=xxxxxxxx" (if It has Password)
2. and just type the Zoom's ID on same textbox if it has no Password.

And at the name you just can type like
```
[name]_[kota]
=> Yoel Mountanus Sitorus_Pematangsiantar
```
and then will shown like that.. Fuckin' cool right?:V<br>
I'm just too lazy dude hahaha.<br><br>

Oh yaa you can edit it from the script.js file<br>
edit the "data" dictionary<br>

```javascript
let data = {name:"Yoel Mountanus Sitorus",
            nrp:"5025211078",
            kota:"Siantar",
            n3:"078",
            fname:"Yoel",
            dept:"Teknik Informatika",
            fak:"FTEIC",
            div:"Divisi Pendidikan",
            anjai:"halo"}; 
```
u will see this stuff and u can add some more.<br>
example u add
```
bapak: "Anjai lu"
```

Then when u open the HTML file just type<br>
```
[bapak]123
//Then it will shown
=> Anjai lu123
```

U got the point rightt??<br>
